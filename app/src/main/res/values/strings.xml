    <string name="E100" translatable="false">Curcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by some plants. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is sold as an herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, food flavoring, and food coloring.</string>
    <string name="E101" translatable="false">Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and used as a dietary supplement. As a supplement it is used to prevent and treat riboflavin deficiency and prevent migraines. It may be given by mouth or injection.  It is nearly always well tolerated. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. Riboflavin is in the vitamin B group. It is required by the body for cellular respiration. Food sources include eggs, green vegetables, milk, and meat.</string>
    <string name="E102" translatable="false">Tartrazine is a commonly used color all over the world, mainly for yellow, and can also be used with Brilliant Blue FCF (FD&amp;C Blue 1, E133) or Green S (E142) to produce various green shades.</string>
    <string name="E103" translatable="false">Alkannin is a natural dye that is obtained from the extracts of plants from the borage family Alkanna tinctoria that are found in the south of France. The dye is used as a food coloring and in cosmetics. It is used as a red-brown food additive in regions such as Australia, and is designated in Europe as the E number E103, but is no longer approved for use. Alkannin has a deep red color in a greasy or oily environment and a violet color in an alkaline environment.</string>
    <string name="E104" translatable="false"><![CDATA[Quinoline Yellow is used as a greenish yellow food additive in certain countries, designated in Europe as the E number E104. In the EU and Australia, Quinoline Yellow is permitted in beverages and is used in foods, like sauces, decorations, and coatings; Quinoline Yellow is not listed as a permitted food additive in Canada or the US, where it is permitted in medicines and cosmetics and is known as D&C Yellow 10.]]></string>
    <string name="E105" translatable="false">Fast Yellow AB is an azo dye. It used to be used as a food dye, designated in Europe by the E number E105. It is now delisted in both Europe and USA and is forbidden if used in foods and drinks, as toxicological data has shown it is harmful. E105 has been implicated in non-atopic asthma.</string>
    <string name="E106" translatable="false">Flavin mononucleotide is also used as an orange-red food colour additive, designated in Europe as E number E101a.  E106, a very closely related food dye, is riboflavin-5′-phosphate sodium salt, which consists mainly of the monosodium salt of the 5′-monophosphate ester of riboflavin. It is rapidly turned to free riboflavin after ingestion. It is found in many foods for babies and young children as well as jams, milk products, and sweets and sugar products.</string>
    <string name="E107" translatable="false">Yellow 2G is a food coloring denoted by E number E107. It has the appearance of a yellow powder, and it is soluble in water. It is a synthetic yellow azo dye.  It appears to cause allergic or intolerant reactions, particularly amongst those with an aspirin intolerance and asthma sufferers. It is one of the colors that the Hyperactive Children\'s Support Group recommends be eliminated from the diet of children.  It is not listed by the UK\'s Food Standards Agency among EU approved food additives. Its use is also banned in Austria, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.</string>
    <string name="E110" translatable="false">Sunset Yellow is used in food, cosmetics, and drugs.:4 For example, it is used in candy, desserts, snacks, sauces, and preserved fruits.:463–465 Sunset Yellow is often used in conjunction with E123, amaranth, to produce a brown colouring in both chocolates and caramel.</string>
    <string name="E111" translatable="false">Orange GGN, also known as alpha-naphthol orange, is an azo dye formerly used as a food dye. It is the disodium salt of 1-(m-sulfophenylazo)-2-naphthol-6-sulfonic acid. In Europe, it was denoted by the E Number E111, but has been forbidden for use in foods since 1 January 1978. It has never been included in the food additives list of the Codex Alimentarius. As such, it is forbidden for food use in general, because toxicological data has shown it is harmful.</string>
    <string name="E120" translatable="false">Cochineal In spite of the widespread use of carmine-based dyes in food and cosmetic products, a small number of people have been found to experience occupational asthma, food and cosmetic allergies (such as allergic rhinitis and cheilitis),</string>
    <string name="E121" translatable="false">In the United States, Citrus Red 2 is sometimes used to color oranges. It is only permitted to be used on the peel. It is permitted when the fruit is intended to be eaten, but is not permitted when the fruit is intended or used for processing, for example to manufacture orange juice. It is used on some oranges from the US state of Florida but is banned in the US states of California and Arizona. It has been linked to health risks in studies using rats and mice</string>
    <string name="E122" translatable="false">Azorubine has shown no evidence of mutagenic or carcinogenic properties and an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 0–4 mg/kg was established in 1983 by the WHO.:19  No evidence supports broad claims that food coloring causes food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children.:452 It is possible that certain food coloring may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence is weak.</string>
    <string name="E123" translatable="false">Since 1976 Amaranth has been banned in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a suspected carcinogen. Its use is still legal in some countries, notably in the United Kingdom where it is most commonly used to give Glacé cherries their distinctive color.</string>
    <string name="E124" translatable="false">There is no evidence of carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, or reproductive and developmental toxicity at the permitted dietary exposures; the European acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 0.7 mg/kg and the WHO/FAO ADI is 4 mg/kg.:460  The production process may result in unsulphonated aromatic amines present in concentrations of up to 100 mg/kg which may be linked to cancer. The lake pigment form of the colour additive can also increase the intake of aluminium beyond the tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 1 mg/kg/week. Therefore, the limit for aluminium may be adjusted to accommodate for this.</string>
    <string name="E125" translatable="false">In the United States, it is not permitted for use in food or ingested drugs and may only be used in externally applied drugs and cosmetics. An exception was added in 1965 to allow the coloring of maraschino cherries, which then were considered mainly decorative and not a foodstuff. This exception was repealed in 1976 due to mounting evidence over its safety concerns. In the European Union, it is not permitted as a food additive.</string>
    <string name="E126" translatable="false">Ponceau 6R, or Crystal ponceau 6R, Crystal scarlet, Brilliant crystal scarlet 6R, Acid Red 44, or C.I. 16250, is a red azo dye. It is soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. It is used as a food dye, with E number E126. It is also used in histology, for staining fibrin with the MSB Trichrome stain. It usually comes as disodium salt.</string>
    <string name="E127" translatable="false">As a result of efforts begun in the 1970s, in 1990 the U.S. FDA had instituted a partial ban on erythrosine, citing research that high doses have been found to cause cancer in rats. In June 2008, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) petitioned the FDA for a complete ban on erythrosine in the United States.</string>
    <string name="E128" translatable="false">It is one of the colourants that the Hyperactive Children\'s Support Group recommends be eliminated from the diet of children.  In July 2007 the EFSA established E128 is potentially carcinogenic as it forms aniline in the body when consumed.</string>
    <string name="E129" translatable="false">Allura Red has been heavily studied by food safety groups in North America and Europe, but remains in wide use and wide acceptance.  The UK FSA commissioned a study of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow, Carmoisine (dubbed the \"Southampton 6\")), and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages. The study found \"a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity\" in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended\".</string>

As food additive E249, potassium nitrite is a preservative similar to sodium nitrite and is approved for usage in the EU,[5] USA,[6] Australia and New Zealand[7] (where it is listed under its INS number 249).</string>
    <string name="E250">In the early 1900s, irregular curing was commonplace. This led to further research surrounding the use of sodium nitrite as an additive in food, standardizing the amount present in foods to minimize the amount needed while maximizing its food additive role.[7] Through this research, sodium nitrite has been found to inhibit growth of disease-causing microorganisms; give taste and color to the meat; and inhibit lipid oxidation that leads to rancidity.[7] The ability of sodium nitrite to address the above-mentioned issues has led to production of meat with improved food safety, extended storage life and improving desirable color/taste.[7] It has the E number E250. Potassium nitrite (E249) is used in the same way. It is approved for usage in the EU,[8][9] USA[10] and Australia and New Zealand.[11]</string>
